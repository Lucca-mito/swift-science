/// A probability distribution that can be randomly sampled.
///
/// Sample one random ``ProbabilityDistribution/Value`` from the distribution with the ``sample()`` method, or sample
/// `count` random values with ``sample(count:)``.
///
/// ## Conforming to the Samplable protocol
/// Creating a custom probability distribution conforming to ``Samplable`` only requires implementing the ``sample()`` function.
///
/// > Tip: All probability distributions conforming to ``ClosedFormQuantile`` automatically get a ``sample()`` implementation
/// that uses [inverse transform sampling]. Distributions that don't have a closed-form quantile can instead conform to
/// ``Samplable``with a custom sampling function. For example, ``NormalDistribution`` conforms to ``Samplable`` using
/// the Boxâ€“Muller transform.
///
/// > See: The ``ClosedFormQuantile/sample()`` function in ``ClosedFormQuantile``.
