    /// The skewness of the distribution.
    ///
    /// Also known as the third standardized moment.

    /// The distribution's [moment-generating function].

    /// [moment-generating function]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function
    ///
    /// - Returns: The expected value of exp(`t` ùëã) where ùëã is a random variable following the distribution.
    ///
    /// ## Usage notes
    /// - Precondition: `t` ‚â• 0
    ///
    /// `momentGeneratingFunction(0)` is always 1.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let normal = NormalDistribution<Double>.standard
    /// print( normal.momentGeneratingFunction(1) ) // Approximately 1.64872
    /// print( normal.sample(count: 1_000_000).map(Double.exp).mean() ) // Approximately 1.64872
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Discussion
    /// The moment-generating function is commonly abbreviated as MGF.
    /// Every probability distribution that has an MGF has a _unique_ MGF.
