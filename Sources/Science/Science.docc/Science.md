# ``Science``
Swift Science is a scientific computing package for Swift.

## Generics
Swift Science has a strong focus on *generic programming*. Packages for scientific computing often have some or all of their functionality locked to a specific point in the 
precisionâ€“performance spectrum, usually 64-bit (Double) precision. But what if you need 
In contrast, all functions,
structures, and protocols in Swift Science are available from
