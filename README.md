# Swift Science
Swift Science is a scientific computing package for Swift.

## Documentation
Please see [the documentation website](https://lucca-mito.github.io/swift-science/documentation/science).

## Why Swift Science?
Choosing Swift for your scientific code enables it to have both:
- The performance and correctness of a compiled, statically-typed language.
- The abstractions and safety of a modern, high-level language.

Additionally, the Swift Science package has a strong focus on *generic programming*. Instead of locking you to
a specific point in the precisionâ€“performance spectrum, all functions, structures, and 
protocols in Swift Science support:
- Extended- and arbitrary-precision floats and integers when prioritizing computational accuracy.
- Machine-size floats (`Double`) and integers (`Int`) by default to prioritize speed.
- `Float16` and `Int8` when prioritizing memory usage.

And anywhere in between.

## Contributing
This project is very new. All suggestions and contributions are welcome.
